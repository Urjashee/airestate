## Technologies used


### cors
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism for integrating applications. CORS defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain.

### postman
Postman can be used to write functional tests, integration tests, regression tests, and more. Postman's Node. js-based runtime contains support for common patterns and libraries that you can use to build tests quickly.

### bcrypt
Bcrypt is a valuable tool to use to hash and store passwords. Its major benefits include: Slow runtime. Bcrypt is a slow-functioning algorithm that takes time to create password hashes and requires time to decrypt them, significantly slowing hacker attempts to break the bcrypt hash.

### jsonwebtoken
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.
